# Radial Pattern Generator:

## Description

The Radial Pattern Generator is a Python application utilizing the Turtle graphics library. It creates visually appealing radial patterns using basic geometric shapes like squares and hexagons. The program places these shapes in different corners of the window, each with a random fill color, forming a symmetrical and colorful display.

## Features

- Draws radial patterns with squares and hexagons.
- Random color filling for each shape.
- Patterns are positioned in all four corners of the window.
- Customizable number of shapes, size, and positioning.
